# Weapon-Detection-for-Police-use
AI-powered weapon detection system built for a project. Uses COCO-SSD and computer vision to detect guns/knives in CCTV or drone feeds, sending instant alerts to law enforcement for faster response and improved public safety.
# üîç Weapon Detection System ‚Äì Police Hackathon Project  

This project was developed during a **Police Hackathon** to enhance public safety using **AI-powered weapon detection**. The system leverages the **COCO-SSD deep learning model** to detect weapons (such as guns and knives) in real-time from **CCTV or drone feeds**, instantly sending alerts to law enforcement for faster response.

## Key Features  
- **Real-time Detection** ‚Äì Identifies weapons in live video streams or uploaded images.  
- **AI-Powered Vision** ‚Äì Built on the **COCO-SSD model** for reliable detection.  
- **Instant Alerts** ‚Äì Generates alerts when a weapon is detected.  
- **Scalable** ‚Äì Works with CCTV cameras, drones, or cloud deployments.  
- **Lightweight** ‚Äì Optimized for edge and resource-limited devices.
